**Title:** I forked Bitcoin Core to add RandomX (CPU Mining) - Here is what I learned

**Body:**

Hi r/cpumining,

I've been frustrated that I can't mine Bitcoin on my CPU anymore. It feels like the customized hardware (ASIC) era killed the original "One CPU, One Vote" vision.

So, as a learning project, I decided to fork **Bitcoin Core** and replace SHA256 with **RandomX** (the same algorithm Monero uses).

**The Result: BitMinti**
*   It actually works. I'm mining blocks on my MacBook.
*   I removed the checkpoints so it's a pure chain from Genesis.
*   I ported the outcome to a standalone verified network.

I'm not doing an ICO or a premine. I just want to see if a community can grow around a pure CPU-Bitcoin chain.

If you have a few CPU cycles to spare, I'd love for you to try breaking my testnet/mainnet.

Let me know if you find any bugs!
