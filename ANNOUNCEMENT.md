Important: This is not another Bitcoin fork for profit. This is a return to Satoshi's vision.
Bitcoin has been hijacked by industrial mining cartels (ASICs), whales, and institutions.
We respect Bitcoin's history, but we believe the "One CPU, One Vote" vision is dead on the main chain.
A fork is the right way to restore this vision.

**Why did I make this fork?**
Because ordinary people can no longer mine Bitcoin. The system is centralized.
I want a coin where a student in a dorm room has the same mining chance as a corporation.

### Here are the details:

1. **Code Base:** Bitcoin Core (Hardened) + RandomX + LWMA.
2. **Fair Launch:** Started from scratch (Genesis Block). No Premine. No ICO.
3. **Consensus:** **RandomX** (CPU-only). ASICs are bricked. GPUs are inefficient.
4. **Name:** BTC3 (Bitcoin 3.0 / Third Era)
5. **Block Target:** 10 minutes (Standard).
6. **Supply:** 21 Million (Standard).
7. **Difficulty:** LWMA-2 (Linear Weighted Moving Average) for fast response to hashrate changes.

**Action plan:**

- **I want to start mining. What can I do just now?**
  1. Download the binaries from GitHub.
  2. Run `./bin/btc3d -daemon` (It will sync instantly, it's new).
  3. Generate an address: `./bin/btc3-cli getnewaddress`.
  4. Mine: `./bin/btc3-cli generatetoaddress 1 <your_address>`.

- **I want to help with development / design / marketing ...**
  Please check the GitHub issues or join us.

- **I want to integrate new currency in my services**
  BTC3 is fully RPC-compatible with Bitcoin Core. If you support Bitcoin, you support BTC3.
  Port: `13337`.
