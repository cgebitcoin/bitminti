# BTC3 Manifesto  
## Participation Over Concentration

---

## 1. Why BTC3 Exists

Bitcoin began as a system that **anyone could run, mine, and understand**.  
Over time, participation became dominated by capital, scale, and professional infrastructure.

BTC3 exists to explore a simple question:

> **What does a Bitcoin-like network look like when participation comes first again?**

BTC3 is not a replacement for Bitcoin.  
It is an **experimental Bitcoin fork** focused on early-stage fairness, learning, and open participation.

---

## 2. What BTC3 Is Not

BTC3 is **not**:

- an investment product  
- a token sale  
- a VC-backed project  
- a promise of profit  
- a shortcut to wealth  

There is **no premine**, **no insider allocation**, and **no privileged access**.

BTC3 is open-source, experimental, and transparent by design.

## 3. Participation Over Whales

BTC3 does not attempt to “ban” whales — no protocol can do that.  
Instead, BTC3 removes **structural advantages** that allow capital and scale to dominate participation early.

We believe:

- Capital should not decide who gets to participate  
- Scale should not determine legitimacy  
- Early networks should reward **learning and contribution**, not accumulation  

BTC3 is designed so **ordinary people can meaningfully participate from the beginning**.

## 4. Mining for Humans, Not Corporations

BTC3 emphasizes:

- CPU-accessible mining  
- Intentional block production  
- Mining aligned with real transactions  
- Avoidance of continuous empty-block inflation  

Mining exists to **secure real activity**, not to extract value from an idle network.

Early miners are participants, not extractors.

---

## 5. No Insiders, No Shortcuts

BTC3 has:

- No premine  
- No VC allocation  
- No private deals  
- No special privileges  

Every coin exists because a block was mined.  
Every block exists because someone participated.

This principle is non-negotiable.

---

## 6. Learning Comes First

BTC3 is built for:

- developers  
- students  
- experimenters  
- people who want to *understand* Bitcoin, not just hold it  

Running a node, mining a block, and sending a transaction should be **accessible experiences**, not elite activities.

BTC3 values understanding over speculation.

---

## 7. Honest Limits

BTC3 does not claim:

- permanent fairness  
- immunity from concentration  
- inevitable success  

BTC3 offers **a fair beginning** and **radical transparency**.  
History will decide the outcome.

---

## 8. An Invitation, Not a Promise

BTC3 does not promise returns.  
BTC3 invites participation.

If you want to:

- run a node  
- mine with modest hardware  
- read and modify the code  
- understand Bitcoin’s foundations  

You are welcome.

---

## 9. The Experiment

BTC3 exists to explore one idea:

> **Can a Bitcoin-style network begin with people instead of capital?**

There is no guarantee of success.  
Only a commitment to openness.

### BTC3

**Participation before profit.**  
**Learning before speculation.**  
**People before capital.**
